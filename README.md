## Export-Import Visualization.

This repository contains an Excel-based data visualization project that explores the landscape of Kenyaâ€™s imports and exports in the aftermath of the 2024 Protests and the enactment of the Finance Bill 2024.

The Finance Bill introduced major policy changes, including:

1. An increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) to 16% of the gross price.
2. New taxation on imported goods, in an effort to increase home grown goods.

These measures together with the political tensions were bound to have an impact on both the domestic and international trade in the country.

Through this project, you will find:

1.Clear visual trends showing the decline in imports following increased taxation.
2.Comparative export performance data before and after the policy shift.
3.Insights into how financial policy directly affects international trade and domestic markets

The goal of this project is to study the effects of various variables can affect the trade of a given country.
